# Data Collector

This repository contains a simple KTor server used to process HTTP requests generated by Kord Extensions bots with
data collection enabled.

It provides a simple API allowing for submission of bot-specific data (under each data collection mode), and the 
self-service removal of said data via HTTP request.

For information on the data collection system and what data is collected, please 
[read the documentation](https://docs.kordex.dev/data-collection).
